# Recurring Searches Storage

This directory stores recurring job search configurations as JSON files.

Each file represents one scheduled search and contains:
- Search criteria (job titles, location, employment type, etc.)
- Frequency settings (daily/weekly)
- Email notification settings
- Run history

**Note:** These files are automatically managed by the application via GitHub API.
Do not manually edit these files unless you know what you're doing.
